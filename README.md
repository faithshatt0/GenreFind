Explanation of our project:

For our project, we created an application that takes in an artist name and outputs the genres associated with that artist. this was done by using Spotify's WEB API. Furthermore, when it comes to the future of this project, we hope to eventually incorporate a song search as well that could also generate the genre of that song. If we had more time, we were also going to incorporate a few more features that would allow the user to view similar artists based on the genres associated with the original artist they searched. In addition to this, we had started another set of code that took in a text file with lyrics to song and outputted the most commonly used words in that song. We completed these sets of code but we ran out of time to actually implement them in the site.

How to use the application:

Once on the site's main page, the user will be greeted with the title of the site "GenreFind" along with a search bar in the top left. From here, the user can enter a an artist name in that search bar. Once the user presses enter or submit, the site renders a new page with the title of the artist found based on the user's input, an image of that artist, as well as the list of genres associated with that artist's music.
